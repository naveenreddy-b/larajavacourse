/*
encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data together 
into a single unit,for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
we can able to acheive data security through encapsulation
we can acheive data hiding
by using getters and setters we can make the data read only or write only
by uisng getters and setters we can have control over the data

static variables or non-static variables = data members
static methods or non-static methods = member functions
