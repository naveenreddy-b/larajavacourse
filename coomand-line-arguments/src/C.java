//JVM will be calling the main method by supplying empty string array object
//if you dont supply anything as a command line argument while executing any class
//if you directly print the array reference you will be getting the memory 
//address of that array object 
//each and every array will be having a length.we can find out the 
//array length by using length property(by calling length property on
//the array reference)
//arrays are also objects in java
//array index will be starting from 0 but length we will calculate from no.1
//if there are no elements are present in the array then we can say that
 //array is empty or size or length is zero
//by default at the time of running whatever the value you are supplying as
//command line argument that will be considered as string type only
