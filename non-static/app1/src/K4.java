//each and every static member(static variable and static methods)will be shared by all the objects of that class
//static int i will be not loaded while creating the object to K4 clss, bcz it is already loaded while K4 class is loading.K4 object is just using the already loaded static int i. even the future objects of all K4 class will be using the same copy of static int i.
