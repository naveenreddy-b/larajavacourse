//an object is a real world entity
//class is a blue print to create the objects
//objects will be having attributes and behaviours
//ex: dog object properties or attributes:name,age,color,breed,gender,weight
                            //behaviours: bark(),chasecat().bite(),chasevehicle
//properties=data members
//behaviours=member functions
//for one class we can able create any number of objects
//G g1= G(class name), g1(reference variable name)(name can be anything)
// = assignment operator(left side assignment)
//new is a keyword and also an operator
//G(); - calling G class no argument constructor
//variable , method follow the case like variableNumberOne,methodNumberOne
// variable name should be a valid identifier
//while you are refering to the class case must be same(as a standard we will write
